      <h2>More About Water-Related Issues in Agriculture</h2>
      <p>
        Water is essential for agriculture, yet itâ€™s becoming increasingly scarce in
        many parts of the world. The growing global population and climate change
        have exacerbated this issue. Efficient water management practices are
        critical for ensuring that farmers can continue to produce food while
        conserving this vital resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern technology, such as satellite data, sensors, and IoT devices, plays
        a significant role in monitoring and managing water usage. By adopting these
        solutions, we can help mitigate the effects of water scarcity on agriculture
        and secure food production for future generations.
